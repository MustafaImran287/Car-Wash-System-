# Automated-Car-Wash-System
Background:
The core idea behind this project is to create an automated system of car wash system that is user-friendly and applicable to different types of vehicles (Mini-Car, Jeep, and Heavy Duty Vehicle).

Implementation:
- Developed a GUI using QT Designer for users to operate it accordingly. A user-friendly GUI with various alarms like low water and detergent level, motor malfunctioning, and extreme temperatures are handled. 
- A remote system is established using Raspberry Pi 
- Data Communication among Arduino Microcontroller and Raspberry Pi
- Interfacing of Sonar sensors to detect the water and detergent levels in separate tanks.
- Integrating temperature and humidity sensors for continuous monitoring of the environment.
- Flexible and Adjustable structure, based on motors is controlled via the microcontroller.

Findings:
A smart car wash system with essential and smart functionality is developed to automate a system and make it easier for drivers as well as companies to make work easier and smarter with latest technologies.
